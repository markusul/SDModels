Spectrally Deconfounded Models (SDModels) is a package with methods to screen for and analyze non-linear sparse direct effects in the presence of unobserved confounding using the spectral deconfounding techniques (@Cevid2020SpectralModels, @Guo2022DoublyConfounding). These methods have been shown to be a good estimate for the true direct effect if we observe many covariates, e.g., high-dimensional settings, and we have fairly dense confounding. Even if the assumptions are violated, it seems like there is not much to lose, and the SDModels will, in general, estimate a function closer to the true one than classical least squares optimization. SDModels provides software for Spectrally Deconfounded Additive Models (SDAMs) (@scheidegger2023spectral) and Spectrally Deconfounded Random Forests (SDForest)(@ulmer2025spectrallydeconfoundedrandomforests).

## Installation

To install the SDModels R package from CRAN, just run

``` r
install.packages(SDModels)
```


You can install the development version of SDModels from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("markusul/SDModels")
```

or

``` r
# install.packages('pak')
pak::pkg_install('markusul/SDModels')
```

## Usage

This is a basic example on how to estimate the direct effect of $X$ on $Y$ using SDForest. You can learn more about analyzing sparse direct effects estimated by SDForest in the article [SDForest](https://www.markus-ulmer.ch/SDModels/articles/SDForest.html).

```{r SDForest}
library(SDModels)

set.seed(42)
# simulation of confounded data
sim_data <- simulate_data_nonlinear(q = 2, p = 50, n = 100, m = 2)
X <- sim_data$X
Y <- sim_data$Y
train_data <- data.frame(X, Y)
# parents
sim_data$j

fit <- SDForest(Y ~ ., train_data)
fit
```

You can also estimate just one Spectrally Deconfounded Regression Tree using the `SDTree` function. See also the article [SDTree](https://www.markus-ulmer.ch/SDModels/articles/SDTree.html).

```{r SDTree, fig.height=7}
Tree <- SDTree(Y ~ ., train_data, cp = 0.01)
#plot(Tree)
```

Or you can estimate a Spectrally Deconfounded Additive Model, with theoretical guarantees, using the `SDAM` function. See also the article [SDAM](https://www.markus-ulmer.ch/SDModels/articles/SDAM.html).

```{r SDAM}
model <- SDAM(Y ~ ., train_data)
model
```
