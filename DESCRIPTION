Description: Spectrally Deconfounded Models (SDModels) is a package with methods 
  to screen for and analyze non-linear sparse direct effects in the presence of 
  unobserved confounding using the spectral deconfounding techniques 
  (Ćevid, Bühlmann, and Meinshausen (2020)<jmlr.org/papers/v21/19-545.html>, 
  Guo, Ćevid, and Bühlmann (2022)<doi.org/10.1214/21-AOS2152>). 
  These methods have been shown to be a good estimate for the true direct effect 
  if we observe many covariates, e.g., high-dimensional settings, and we have 
  fairly dense confounding. Even if the assumptions are violated, it seems like 
  there is not much to lose, and the SDModels will, in general, estimate a function 
  closer to the true one than classical least squares optimization. 
  SDModels provides software for Spectrally Deconfounded Additive Models (SDAMs) 
  (Scheidegger, Guo, and Bühlmann (2025)<doi.org/10.1145/3711116>) and Spectrally Deconfounded Random 
  Forests (SDForest)(Ulmer, Scheidegger, and Bühlmann (2025)<arxiv.org/abs/2502.03969>).
