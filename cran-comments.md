## Resubmission
I have made the following changes:

* I have changed the start of the description and removed the additional linebreaks
* I have added the missing \value documentations
* I have changed dontrun to donttest where possible (in SDAM, SDForest, and SDTree)

I could not find an installation of a package somewhere in SDModels.
